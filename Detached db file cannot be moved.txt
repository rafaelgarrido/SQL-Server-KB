PROBLEM

Detached database is still "in use".

I detached a database. I tried to move the LDF files to a new location. 
I receive the following error 
"Cannot move <database>: Access is denied. Make sure the disk is not full or 
write-protected and that the file is not currently in use".

=====================
ANSWER

The "Access Denied" is caused because in SQL 2005+ the user who detached 
the database is the only user who has rights to the files.
