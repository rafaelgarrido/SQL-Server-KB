Helpful scripts for daily use.

I didn't sign any of the scripts. I could have created, copied, modified or received them.
If I knew the author (other than me), he/she is in the comments.

Never first run a script in Production.

Collaborate if you find errors, improvements or new system versions are tested.


Thanks,

Ricardo Batho
