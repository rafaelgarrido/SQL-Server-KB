Is it very slow to retrieve a report once a day or the first time on the day?
It is possible the w3wp service is loading for the first time after the Application Pool was recycled.



Put this code in a .vbs file. It loads the page without showing any output.

Change the <ReportServerName> and <ReportName> parameter.

You can create a job that executes this .vbs in a scheduled basis

Dim HTTP
Dim url
url = "http://<ReportServerName>/Reports/Pages/Report.aspx?ItemPath=%2f<ReportName>" 
set xmlhttp = CreateObject("MSXML2.XMLHTTP") 
xmlhttp.open "GET", url, false
xmlhttp.send
set xmlhttp = nothing
