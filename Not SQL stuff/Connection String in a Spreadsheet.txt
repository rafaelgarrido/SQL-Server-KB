to verify the connection from an Excel spreadsheet:

open the VB interface (Alt+F11) and type in the immediate window:

?Sheet1.QueryTables(1).Connection

press <enter>


result:
ODBC;DSN=<dsnName>;UID=<User>;APP=Microsoft® Query;WSID=<workstation>;DATABASE=<db_name>;Network=DBMSSOCN;Address=<server>,1433;Trusted_Connection=Yes

This case it uses Windows Integrated security even though there is a UID parameter.
